## Hi there, I'm prateek ðŸ‘‹

I'm from India, a student pursuing Undergraduate degree in Computer Science. My current experience is with Web Technologies (Full Stack) and Cloud native Development. I also like to explore hence currently learning about NLP with Deep Learning and Language modelling.I love to work with various developer communities.

I worked as an LFX mentee under Cilium where I built a kubernetes Operator from scratch using Go programming language.

I am also a Software engineer at Fountane, which is a startup where I collaborate with teams to build software solutions for Clients all over the world.

I am the Founder of [Senseii](https://www.senseii.in) which is a startup, part of [Microsoft for Startups Founder's Hub](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/startups). I believe this solution is very much needed by the world, specifically for People in India because it will make Health and Fitness accessible to people from every background.
